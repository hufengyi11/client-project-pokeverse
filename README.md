## Background
We were given the backend bit by Team Staryu. 

> Team All Staryu - “A virtual space for Pokemon trainers and their Pokemon, with the ability to edit data and encourage social interactions.”

After examining the backend functionalities, taking into account team All Staryu’s vision and Team Rocket’s need for total world domination, we decided to design a Pokedex for all Team Rocket personnel.
